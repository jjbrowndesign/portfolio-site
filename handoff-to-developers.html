          <h3>Creating true Figma components</h3>
          <p>
            After the key designs of the website redesign project had been established (<a href="redesigning-finance-website.html">get the full story here</a>), I took the designs, recreated them using proper Figma components, <a href="creating-design-system.html">created a design system</a>, and built mockups for pages in Figma.</a>
          </p>
          <h3>Writing annotations</h3>
          <p>
            I established an annotation system as I felt it was important and efficient to clearly explain design decisions like interaction states, behaviours and animations before devs get involved, to save them time.</p>
          </p>
          <p><i>I can't show examples of this work due to privacy, but it was based on Femke van Schoonhoven's excellent YouTube content.</i></p>
          <p>

          </p>
          <h3>Creating user stories</h3>
          <p>
            I then worked with business analysts to translate these annotations into detailed user stories in Azure DevOps (similar to Jira) using Given-When-Then acceptance criteria.</p>
            <p>Being involved in this process helped make sure that the UX team were guiding development and setting accessibility and functionality expectations for the later test and UAT phases.

               <div class="hero-left">
                <h2 class="h2-accent">2. Revising designs</h2>
                <h3>Collaborating with cross-functional teams</h3>
                <p>
                  To keep up the pace of the project, I tried to help find design compromises to meet improve velocity while meeting business goals and championing the user (and accessibility, in particular).
                </p>
                <p>For example, we had a multi-functional dropdown that allowed users to sort an investment fund alphabetically by share class, distribution type or currency. This had been designed to be future-proof for some of our more complex funds, which had up to 15 options.
                </p>
                  <p>
                    Throughout the project, I made sure to always be available for ad-hoc calls from developers.</p>
                    <p>This time, when discussing the dropdown with a dev, he cautioned that adding this sorting functionality would take considerably longer.</p>
                      <p>So I decided to analyse the data, and I concluded that this functionality would probably be overkill for three-quarters of the funds.
                    <a href="https://lawsofux.com/millers-law/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Miller's Law</a> tells us that users can keep around 7 items in their mind at a time, so I was happy that users should be okay dealing with all funds with fewer than 7 options.</p>
                    <p>That just left a handful of funds with more than 7 options.</p>

                    <h3>Finding design compromises</h3>

                  <p>I quickly mocked up a simplified version with no sorting, to see how it would look:
                  </p>
                  <picture>
                    <source
                    srcset=img/ux_design/handoff_to_developers/investment_choices_before_and_after@2x.png
                    media="(max-width:767px)"> <img class="case-study-img" id="case-study-img-max"
                    src=img/ux_design/handoff_to_developers/investment_choices_before_and_after@2x.png
                    alt="The shareclass dropdown with multiple complex functionalities, and then a variant using a simple list.">
                  </picture>
                  <p>Looking at the mockup, I was satisfied that the content looked logical, as they mostly differed only by currency which looked easily scannable for users.</p>
                    <p>But I spoke to my UX Researcher and asked her to cover this on a usability test that we would run when the page is live.</p>

                  <h3>Making informed changes</h3>
                    <p>It only took a few hours for me to create the new mockup and think through the logic, but it saved many hours of valuable developer time – and (importantly) it shouldn't have a negative impact on the user.
