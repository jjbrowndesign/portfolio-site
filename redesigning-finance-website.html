          <h2>About the project</h2>
          <h3>Company</h3>
          <p><a href="https://www.bailliegifford.com/en/uk/individual-investors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Baillie Gifford</a>, Edinburgh</p>
          <h3>My role</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Auditing the site to identify problems with consistency, navigation and accessibility.</li>
            <li>Creating Figma prototypes in weekly agile sprints, and iterating based on user feedback.</li>
            <li>Thoughtfully presenting validated designs to secure buy-in from senior leaders.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Time period</h3>
          <p>July 2022 – December 2022</p>
          <h3>Team</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>UX lead</li>
            <li>UX researcher</li>
            <li id="dark-accent-text">UX UI designer <i>(me)</i></li>
            <li>UI designer – agency</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Problem</h3>
          <p>The company had seen huge growth in the number of investors using its marketing-focused website during Covid. As the website came under increased scrutiny, the issues with consistency, navigation and accessibility were proving hard to ignore.</p>
          <h3>Opportunity</h3>
          <p>The Brand team were also working on a rebrand, so this was a perfect opportunity to apply a minimalist, clean UI to the site.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- Part 1 -->
        <section class="hero-left">
          <h2>1. Identifying the problems</h2>
          <p>I conducted an audit of the site using my knowledge of user-centred design principles. I analysed Hotjar clickmaps and user testing videos, and identified a handful of key issues...</p>
          <h3>Poor consistency</h3>
          <p>The site had become bloated, with new UI elements piled on top of old. It was also hugely inconsistent, with components sorely misused, creating huge frustrations for users.</p>

          <details class="accordion-container">
            <button class="accordion">Take a look at an inconsistent component<i class="fa-solid fa-caret-down"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-caret-up"></i></button>
            <summary class="panel">
              <p>A key UI element on the site was a grid of 'tiles':</p>
              <picture> <source srcset=img/ux_design/redesigning_finance_website/multigrid@1x.gif media="(max-width:767px)"> <img class="case-study-img" id="case-study-img-max" src=img/ux_design/redesigning_finance_website/multigrid@1x.gif alt="A video of a user hovering over a handful of unclear image boxes that seem to have links to elsewhere."> </picture>
              <p>When clicked, these tiles would sometimes navigate users to a subpage, sometimes take them to an external site, sometimes open up a document, and sometimes do nothing at all! There were no signifiers to suggest to the user which did which...</p>
              <p>This goes against Nielsen Norman Group's principle of <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/h2s/ten-usability-heuristics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">consistency and standards</a>.</p>
            </summary>
          </details>

          <p><span class="highlight">I solved this by creating unique components for each use case</span> – one design for a set of documents, a different design for a set of links, and so on.</p>

          <h3>Cluttered, confusing navigation</h3>
          <p>The site was a nightmare to navigate around, as shown by the frustrated user videos on Hotjar.</p>
          <details class="accordion-container">
            <button class="accordion">See an example of the poor navigation<i class="fa-solid fa-caret-down"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-caret-up"></i></button>
            <summary class="panel">
              <p>The main navigation bar changed depending on the page you were on – a real red flag from a UX point of view.</p>
              <p>On some pages, it held 11 links: stuffed full of niche projects, short-lived events and links to external microsites.</p>
              <picture> <source srcset=img/ux_design/redesigning_finance_website/identifying_problems@2x.jpg media="(max-width:767px)"> <img class="case-study-img" src=img/ux_design/redesigning_finance_website/identifying_problems@2x.jpg alt="The ugly old website"> </picture>
              <p>It had clearly suffered at the whims of powerful stakeholders overruling user experience!</p>
            </summary>
          </details>

          <p>
            We solved this by setting up a tree test and card-sorting exercise. This helped us to understand how users categorised the site.
            <span class="highlight">I analysed the results and created a logical Information Architecture</span> to work for all our various use-cases.
          </p>
          <p><span class="highlight">I also wrote guidelines in the design system</span> to emphasise that the menu should stay consistent, while identifying some more appropriate UI elements where stakeholder projects could be added in future.</p>

          <h3>Accessibility issues</h3>
          <p>The site was far off our goal to reach WCAG's AA accessibility standards.</p>
          <details class="accordion-container">
            <button class="accordion">Read some of the accessibility failures<i class="fa-solid fa-caret-down"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-caret-up"></i></button>
            <summary class="panel">
              <ul>
                <li>HTML heading tags were not used or were given a wrong hierarchy.</li>
                <li>The body text size was 14px, rather than the <a href="https://www.a11y-collective.com/blog/wcag-minimum-font-size/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recommended minimum of 16px</a>.</li>
                <li>There was text over images without an <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2023/08/designing-accessible-text-over-images-part1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">appropriate overlay or outline</a>.</li>
                <li>Images didn't have alt text.</li>
                <li>Aria-labels were nonexistant.</li>
              </ul>
            </summary>
          </details>
          <p><span class="highlight">I started collaborating more closely with the Brand team to bake accessibility into the brand guidelines</span> from the outset.</p>
          <p>I also made sure all new designs were tested for colour contrast, readability, and more.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- Part 2 -->
        <section class="hero-left">
          <h2>2. The process</h2>
          <h3>Refocusing on the user</h3>
          <p>The project had already started running before our team was hired, which meant <span class="highlight">we had to introduce a research-led, user-centred design process without slowing the process down.</span></p>
          <p>We therefore set up intense weekly test-and-learn sprints, aiming to complete design, prototyping, testing and iteration in time for the weekly stakeholder presentation.</p>
          <p>I thrived in the fast pace of the project, and the ability to re-focus the project on user-centred principles.</p>
          <h3>Learning from analytics</h3>
          <p>I used Hotjar click maps and Google Analytics to inform designs, rather than basing things on stakeholder theories.</p>
          <p>For example, when working on our (highly important) fund pages, <span class="highlight">assessing scroll behaviour on Hotjar revealed that users were giving up on scrolling down the long page.</span></p>
          <p>I wanted an A/B test to compare some options. So I created two prototypes in Figma. Firstly, a similar scroll-based navigation:</p>
          <picture> <source srcset=img/ux_design/redesigning_finance_website/iterating_and_testing_2@2x.gif media="(max-width:767px)"> <img class="case-study-img" src=img/ux_design/redesigning_finance_website/iterating_and_testing_2@2x.gif alt="User test of vertical navigation"> </picture>
          <p>And then a tabbed alternative:</p>
          <picture> <source srcset=img/ux_design/redesigning_finance_website/iterating_and_testing_1@2x.gif media="(max-width:767px)"> <img class="case-study-img" src=img/ux_design/redesigning_finance_website/iterating_and_testing_1@2x.gif alt="User test of horizontal navigation"> </picture>
          <p>The UX researcher put the two options in front of users on UserTesting.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="highlight">
              The usability testing revealed that the
              <b>tabbed navigation</b>
              had a higher ease of completion rating</span
            >
            of 4.6 out 5 (compared to 4.2 out of 5).
          </p>
          <p>I then assessed the user feedback in detail, making iterative tweaks to reach a final design.</p>

          <h3>Presenting solutions to stakeholders</h3>
          <p>I would then present the designs back to the project group – including senior leaders in the business.</p>
          <p><span class="highlight">The company had a history of stakeholders overruling design decisions, so I relied on my diplomacy skills to navigate any pushback.</span> The validation provided by our research often proved invaluable for this.</p>

          <h2>3. Applying beautiful, minimal UI</h2>
          <h3>Collaborating on visual design</h3>
          <p>Finally, we started the process of applying the finishing touches, based off the emerging brand guidelines, together with the agency's UI designer.</p>
          <p>I made sure our work met our AA accessibility standards; for example, I set up a more logical typographic hierarchy, added consistency to button states, and pushed for larger, more accessible font sizes.</p>
