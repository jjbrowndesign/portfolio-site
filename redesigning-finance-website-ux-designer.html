        <p>July 2022 – December 2022</p>

      <h3>Problem</h3>
              <p>The company had seen a huge growth in the number of investors using its website during Covid. As the website came under increased scrutiny from new users who hadn't learned its unique patterns, the issues with consistency, navigation and accessibility were proving hard to ignore.</p>
      <h3>Opportunity</h3>
            <p>The Brand team were also working on a rebrand, so this became a perfect opportunity to apply a minimalist, clean UI to the site, maximising the benefits of the <a href="https://lawsofux.com/aesthetic-usability-effect/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">aesthetic-usability effect</a>.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="container">
        <!-- Part 1 -->
        <div class="hero-left">
          <h2 class="h2-accent">1. Identifying the problems</h2>
          <p>
            When I first joined the company, I conducted a heuristic evaluation of the site based on my knowledge of user-centred design principles. I then analysed HotJar clickmaps and my Research colleague watched user testing videos. We came to the same conclusions...
          </p>
          <h3>Consistency</h3>
          <p>
          <b>Sitewide consistency was poor, leaving the user to learn new
            patterns on every page.</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            This goes against Nielsen Norman Group's principle of <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">consistency and standards</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, pages were frequently dominated by grids of equal-sized tiles. When clicked, these tiles would sometimes navigate
            users to a subpage, sometimes take them to a different section of the site, sometimes open up a PDF, and sometimes do
            nothing at all!
          </p>
          <p>
            But there were no signifiers to suggest to the user which did which...
          </p>
          <picture>
            <source
            srcset=img/ux_design/redesigning_finance_website/multigrid@1x.gif
            media="(max-width:767px)"> <img id="single-hero-img"
            class="hero-img"
            src=img/ux_design/redesigning_finance_website/multigrid@1x.gif
            alt="A video of a user hovering over a handful of unclear image boxes that seem to have links to elsewhere.">
          </picture>
          <p class="action-points">
            → We therefore decided to move away from these misleading UI elements, creating bespoke components for links (following recognisable patterns from other websites) and for documents (with signifiers to differentiate them for the user).
          </p>


          <h3>Navigation</h3>
          <p>
            <b>Navigation was cluttered, illogical and inconsistent.</b></p>
            <p>
              The
              main navigation bar held 11 items at times: stuffed full of niche projects, short-lived
              events and links to external microsites.
            </p>
            <p>Previously there had been nobody to
          'gatekeep' areas like navigation menus to make sure user experience was championed alongside competing business goals.</p>

            → It was clear we needed to set up a tree test or card-sorting exercise to establish a logic Information Architecture. And, once established, we would need to be more protective of this menu in future.
          </p>
          <h3>Accessibility and inclusivity</h3>
          <p>
            <b>Everywhere you looked, there were accessibility issues.</b></p>
            <p>For example:
            <ul>
              <li>The body text size was 14px, rather than the <a href="https://www.a11y-collective.com/blog/wcag-minimum-font-size/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recommended minimum of 16px</a>.</li>
              <li>There was white or black text over images without an <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2023/08/designing-accessible-text-over-images-part1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">appropriate overlay or outline</a>.</li>
              <li>HTML heading tags were not used or were given a wrong hierarchy.</li>
              <li>Images didn't have alt text.</li>
              <li>Aria-labels were nonexistant.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p class="action-points">
            → As well as adding all of these improvements into our designs, we also made sure to collaborate with teams elsewhere in the business; for example, I worked with colleagues in Brand to improve colours in charts, ensuring good contrast and differentiation.

        <!-- Part 2 -->
        <div class="hero-left">
          <h2 class="h2-accent">2. Solving the problems</h2>
          <h3>Refocusing on the user</h3>
          <p>
            The company had only just set up its UX team. So, when we arrived, the project was already
            partway through an unstructured discovery process that had unfortunately failed to engage with users and their problems.
          </p>          
          <p>
            As a team, we took the decision to run weekly test-and-learn sprints, so we could refocus the process back on the user without slowing the project down.</p>
            <h3>Prototyping and testing</h3>

            <p>At the start of each week, I would use tools like <a href="https://mobbin.com/browse/web/ui-elements" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mobbin</a> and conduct some competitor analysis to create a handful of wireframes that might solve the problems relevant to that page.</p>
            <p>These were created and prototyped in Figma (which I'm luckily pretty fast at using).</p>
            <p>For example, I proposed three different styles of filtering for our investment strategies page:</p>
            <picture>

              click results showing popular clicks far down the page">
            </picture>
            <p>The team would discuss
            their relative merits and select two especially promising options.</p>    
            <p>Next, our amazing UX Researcher would set up
            unmoderated usability tests on UserTesting. We would then assess the findings and data to conclude which design to progress, and I would make iterative tweaks based on any important user feedback.</p>
            
            <h3>Presenting validated designs to stakeholders</h3>
            <p>I would then present it back to the wider project group, and the Researcher would provide the accompanying research results to back up our designs.
          </p>
          <p>This collaborative approach took a lot of hard work and trust, as we had to work quickly and relied on each other to keep the process moving.</p>
        <p>But it meant we were able to embed user research back into a process that had almost forgotten about its users! It allowed us to demonstrate to the business the importance of validating designs, and we managed to keep up the pace of the project too.</p>

            <p>
              I had concerns that our core products (investment funds) were presented on incredibly
              dense pages.</p>
              <p>To test this hypothesis, I indentified some key content (factsheets, ISIN numbers and portfolios) through Hotjar click maps and stakeholder input.</p>
              <p>I then analysed the scroll depth to reveal that users were giving up on scrolling down the <b>long!</b> page.</p>
              </p>
                <p>We then conducted some usability testing, which confirmed that users were failing to find this content. In some cases, this was no doubt due to

                  <p>The poor text hierarchy also seemed to be a factor, based on the user interviews.</p>

              The user testing revealed that the

              had a higher ease of completion rating of 4.6 out 5 (compared to
              4.17 out of 5). So, after a few further tweaks to the design, we were able to present our findings to the business and validate our suggestion.

            It was at this stage that I set down some key accessibility and usability requirements, based on our early heuristic evalution. For example, there was no typographic hierarchy, the button states were inconsistent, and some inaccessible font sizes had crept in.
