      <h3>Problem</h3>
              <p>The company had seen a huge growth in the number of investors using its website during Covid. As the website came under increased scrutiny from new users who hadn't learned its unique patterns, the issues with consistency, navigation and accessibility were proving hard to ignore.</p>
      <h3>Opportunity</h3>
            <p>The Brand team were also working on a rebrand, so this became a perfect opportunity to apply a minimalist, clean UI to the site, maximising the benefits of the <a href="https://lawsofux.com/aesthetic-usability-effect/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">aesthetic-usability effect</a>.</p>

        <div class="hero-left">
          <h2 class="h2-accent">1. Identifying the problems</h2>
          <p>
            When I first joined the company, I conducted a heuristic evaluation of the site based on my knowledge of user-centred design principles. I then analysed HotJar clickmaps and user testing videos, and identified a handful of issues...
          </p>
          <h3>Consistency</h3>
          <p>
          <b>Sitewide consistency was poor.</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, a key UI element on the site was a grid of 'tiles':</p>
            <picture>
              <source
              srcset=img/ux_design/redesigning_finance_website/multigrid@1x.gif
              media="(max-width:767px)"> <img id="single-hero-img"
              class="hero-img"
              src=img/ux_design/redesigning_finance_website/multigrid@1x.gif
              alt="A video of a user hovering over a handful of unclear image boxes that seem to have links to elsewhere.">
            </picture>
            <p>When clicked, these tiles would sometimes navigate
            users to a subpage, sometimes take them to a different section of the site, sometimes open up a PDF, and sometimes do
            nothing at all! There were no signifiers to suggest to the user which did which...
          </p>
          <p>
            This goes against Nielsen Norman Group's principle of <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">consistency and standards</a>.
          </p>
          <p class="action-points">
            → Our solution was to move away from this misleading pattern, creating bespoke components for links and documents – following recognisable patterns from other websites.
          </p>


          <h3>Navigation</h3>
          <p>
            <b>Navigation was cluttered, illogical and inconsistent.</b></p>
            <p>
              The
              main navigation bar held 11 items at times: stuffed full of niche projects, short-lived
              events and links to external microsites.
            </p>
            <picture>

              srcset=img/ux_design/redesigning_finance_website/identifying_problems@2x.jpg
              media="(max-width:767px)"> <img id="single-hero-img"
              class="hero-img"

              alt="The ugly old website">
            </picture>
            <p>Previously there had been nobody to
          'gatekeep' areas like navigation menus to make sure user experience was championed alongside competing business goals.</p>

          
          <p class="action-points">
            → We decided to set up a tree test and card-sorting exercise to establish a logical Information Architecture. We knew we needed to be more protective of this menu in future.
          </p>
          <h3>Accessibility and inclusivity</h3>
          <p>
            <b>Everywhere you looked, there were accessibility issues.</b></p>
            <p>For example:
            <ul>
              <li>The body text size was 14px, rather than the <a href="https://www.a11y-collective.com/blog/wcag-minimum-font-size/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recommended minimum of 16px</a>.</li>
              <li>There was white or black text over images without an <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2023/08/designing-accessible-text-over-images-part1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">appropriate overlay or outline</a>.</li>
              <li>HTML heading tags were not used or were given a wrong hierarchy.</li>
              <li>Images didn't have alt text.</li>
              <li>Aria-labels were nonexistant.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>

          <p class="action-points">
            → We implemented fixes to all of the above issues to meet our aims of AA WCAG accessibility standards, and we collaborated with the Brand team to bake accessibility into the brand guidelines.

        <!-- Part 2 -->
        <div class="hero-left">
          <h2 class="h2-accent">2. The process</h2>
          <h3>Refocusing on the user</h3>     
          <p>
            As a team, we took the decision to run intense weekly test-and-learn sprints, so we could refocus the process back on the user without slowing the project down.</p>
            <h3>Prototyping, testing and iterating</h3>

            <p>I started by conducting competitor analysis and researching patterns on <a href="https://mobbin.com/browse/web/ui-elements" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mobbin</a>. I then created a handful of Figma wireframes that might solve the specific page's problems.</p>
            <p>At design crit meetings, the team discussed
            their relative merits and selected the two best options. I turned these into prototypes and our UX Researcher set up
            unmoderated usability tests on UserTesting.</p>
            <p>We would then assess the results, and I'd make iterative tweaks based on this feedback to create a final design proposal.</p>
            
            <h3>Presenting solutions to stakeholders</h3>
            <p>I would then present the validated designs back to the project group, and negotiate any pushback armed with our research results.
          </p>
          <p>This collaborative approach took a lot of dedication, as we had to work quickly to meet project timelines, but I thrived in that fast pace.</p>
        <p>It meant we were able to embed user research back into the process, and it allowed us to demonstrate the importance of validating designs to the business.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <!-- Part 3 - Highlight section -->
      <div class="container">
        <div class="hero" id="pale-accent">
          <div class="hero-text">
            <h2 class="h2-accent">An example sprint week</h2>
            <p class="key-points">
              Our product (i.e. fund) pages were the business' most important pages in terms of sharing information with users and gathering investment, but we had some concerns about their usability.</p>
  
            <h3>Gathering requirements</h3>
            <p>
              I spoke to some subject matter experts to identify key content that they would expect users to be looking for.
I confirmed this on Hotjar click maps.</p>
<h3>Analysing performance</h3>
              <p>Checking scroll behaviour on Hotjar revealed that users were giving up on scrolling down the long page.
                This implied that another scroll-based page might not be the ideal solution.</p>
              </p>
              <h3>Running competitor analysis</h3>
<p>I conducted some competitor analysis to see how others in the industry were structuring their navigation.
  An incredibly common UI trend was horizontal (tabbed) navigation, without anchor links or long page scrolls.</p>
              <h3>Conducting usability testing</h3>
                <p>The UX Researcher arranged for some users to try out our site and we analysed the videos.
It seemed as though they were often missing the key content because it:
was buried lower down the page
in a low-contrast (grey) sidebar
without any text hierarchy to signpost to it.</p>
  <h3>Prototyping and wireframing</h3>
  <p>So I created prototypes for a vertical tabbed navigation:
            </p>

          <div class="hero-text">
            <h3>Iterating based on research outcomes</h3>

            <p>
              The usability testing revealed that the
              <b>horizontal tabbed navigation</b>
              had a higher ease of completion rating of 4.6 out 5 (compared to
              4.2 out of 5). After a few further tweaks to the design, we were able to present our validated design to the business.
            </p>
            <h3>Presenting to stakeholders</h3>

            I made iterative changes based on feedback.
We then explained the research results to stakeholders, and I presented the validated final designs.

          <h3>Collaborating on mid-fidelity mockups</h3>
          <p>
            The agency's UI Designer then did a great first iteration of the visual design, bringing the brand to life. I collaborated with him to set down some key accessibility and usability requirements, based on our early heuristic evalution. For example, we worked on a stronger typographic hierarchy, more consistent button states, and larger, more accessible font sizes.
