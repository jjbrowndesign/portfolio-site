          <h2 class="h2-accent">1. Identifying the problems</h2>
          
          <h3>Consistency</h3>
          <p>
            Sitewide consistency was poor, leaving the user to learn new
            patterns and UI elements on every page.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, pages were frequently dominated by a ‘multigrid’ of equal-sized tiles; when clicked, these tiles would sometimes take
            users to a subpage, sometimes take them to a different section of the site, sometimes open up a PDF, and sometimes do
            nothing at all.
          </p>

            alt="A video of a user hovering over a handful of unclear image boxes that seem to have links to elsewhere.">
          </picture>
          
          <p>
            We saw confusion about this time and time again on HotJar clickmaps and UserTesting
            videos.
          </p>

          <h3>Navigation</h3>
          <p>Previously there had been nobody to
          'gatekeep' areas like navigation menus to make sure user experience was championed alongside competing business goals.</p>
          <p>
            With no logical Information Architecture to organise content, the
            main navigation bar held 11 items at times: stuffed full of niche projects, short-lived
            events and links to external microsites.
          </p>

          <h3>Accessibility and inclusivity</h3>
          <p>
            Meanwhile, everywhere you looked, there were accessibility issues: from the standard body text size of 14px to the
            regular use of white/black text over images without an appropriate background overlay or outline.
          </p>
          <p>
           Behind the scenes, images didn't have alt text, HTML heading classes were misused, and aria-labels were nonexistant.
          </p>
          <p>
I therefore set about collaborating with other areas of the business. I worked with my Graphic Design and Brand colleagues to improve colour contrast in their charts, and I learnt from the neurodiversity community about autoplaying videos and distracting animations.</p>

        <!-- Part 2 -->
        <div class="hero-left">
          <h2 class="h2-accent">2. Prototyping and testing at pace</h2>
          <p>
            The company had only just set up its UX team. So, when we arrived, the project was already
            partway through an unstructured discovery process that had unfortunately failed to engage with users and their problems.
          </p>
          <h3>Refocusing on the user</h3>
          <p>
            As a team, we ran week-long sprints to rapidly prototype and test design proposals based on analytics and UX best practices.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the start of each week, I would rapidly create a handful of wireframes and we would discuss
            their relative merits.</p>

            </picture>
                        
            <p>Then our amazing UX Researcher set up
            unmoderated user tests on UserTesting to get feedback on the two most promising options. I would then assess her findings and (if necessary) make iterative tweaks to the most successful version, before presenting it back to the project group.

            <h3>Discoverability</h3>
            <p>
              I had concerns that our core products (investment funds) were presented on incredibly
              dense pages.
              </p><p>To check this hypothesis, I indentified some key content (factsheets, ISIN numbers and portfolios) through Hotjar click maps and stakeholder input.</p>
                <p>Then we conducted some testing, which revealed that users were indeed failing to find this content. In some cases, this was no doubt due to

                  >sidebar blindess</a>, as crucial items were hidden in grey boxes on the side of the page.</p><p>I also analysed the scroll depth to reveal that users were giving up on scrolling down the <b>long!</b> page. And interviews with users suggested they were struggling to identify important items due to the poor text hierarchy...

            <h3>Navigation</h3>
            <p>
              Navigation was clearly something we needed to solve urgently. So I created more prototypes so we could test the agency's proposed vertical tabbed navigation...
            </p>

            <p>... and the possibility of horizontal tabbed navigation, which I felt would improve the discoverability of these key sections and would improve consistency between desktop and mobile.</p>

          <div class="hero-text">

              The user testing revealed that the
              <b>horizontal tabbed navigation</b>
              had a higher ease of completion rating of 4.6 out 5 (compared to
              4.17 out of 5). So, after a few further tweaks to the design, we were able to present our findings to the business and validate our suggestion.

            I gave input to ensure that accessibility was considered, as some 12px font sizes had crept in.

              <p>
                It was then my job to take all the mockups, create a Figma component library, improve consistency (in areas like interaction states), and brief the engineers...
