          </ul>
        </p>
      <h3>Problem</h3>
              <p>During our testing of the 404 page, the UX Researcher noticed that users in certain locations were facing difficulty in using the audience selector. 4 out of 10 users could not complete the task! It seemed as though there was an issue with the visibility of the buttons.</p>

          <h2 class="h2-accent">1. Identifying the problem</h2>
          <p>
            The audience selector is a component allowing users to change their location (e.g. UK) and their user type (e.g. Professional investor or Individual investor).</p>
            <p>When originally tested during the <a href="redesigning-finance-website.html">redesign project</a>, no issues had come up. But it seemed as though it hadn't been tested with locations where there was just one user type to select.</p>
          </p>
          <h3>Watching usability tests</h3>
          <p>Users weren't realising that they needed to click 'Professional investor' to proceed, and so were desperately clicking elsewhere:
          </p>

            alt="A screenshot highlighting all the areas that users were clicking, rather than clicking on the right button!">
          </picture>
          <p>For example, some users would take 23 seconds moving their mouse round the component, only to click the wrong button and be sent back to the start of the process:</p>
        </p>

            alt="A video of a user uncertainly hovering over all areas of the audience selector, including the button they're meant to click, before accidentally cancelling the process.">

          <h2 class="h2-accent">2. Testing a simple approach</h2>
          <h3>Creating prototypes</h3>
          <p>
I started by creating a few simple UI tweaks to see if we could make a significant difference with minimal dev time.</p>
<p> For one version, I increased the font size for the button label text, and added a grey stoke around the buttons:        </p>         
<picture>
            <source
            srcset=img/ux_design/designing_new_ui/ui_tweak_option_1@2x.png
            media="(max-width:767px)"> <img class="case-study-img"
            src=img/ux_design/designing_new_ui/ui_tweak_option_1@2x.png
            alt="A screenshot showing one new mockup, including a much bigger font for the text and a grey stroke added around the white buttons.">
          </picture>
        <p>
In the other version, I used more eye-catching background colours for the buttons (while still trying to keep within the minimalist brand guidelines):
</p>          
<picture>
            <source
            srcset=img/ux_design/designing_new_ui/ui_tweak_option_2@2x.png
            media="(max-width:767px)"> <img class="case-study-img"
            src=img/ux_design/designing_new_ui/ui_tweak_option_2@2x.png
            alt="A screenshot showing an alternative mockup, with all unselected buttons being given an eye-catching grey background.">
          </picture>
          <p>These were then set up as prototypes in Figma, ready for testing.</p>
          <h3>Testing</h3>
          <p>The UX Researcher set up an unmoderated test and both options performed okay, with 83% of participants completing the task, but this wasn't enough for such a core functionality.</p>
          <p>Users seemed to be looking for a way to actively apply or save the changes. And some of them were now not following the intended sequence, which added some friction.</p>

          <h2 class="h2-accent">3. Starting from scratch</h2>
          <p>
            So I went back to square one and imagined what I'd have done if I'd been working on the component from the start...</p>
            
          <h3>Competitor analysis</h3>
          <p>
After taking another look at the user research and available analytics, I conducted some competitor analysis and saw a few examples of sites using <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/progressive-disclosure/" target="_blank"
rel="noopener noreferrer">progressive disclosure</a> to good effect, following a step-by-step process and only showing the information relevant to the user at each stage:</p>

    srcset=img/ux_design/designing_new_ui/competitor_progressive_disclosure.png
    media="(max-width:767px)"> <img class="case-study-img"

    alt="Three screenshots from the Aegon website, showing just the region selection at first, then revealing location options, then revealing user type options.">
  </picture>

  <p>And some other sites that used radio buttons alongside a clear confirmation button:
  <picture>
    <source
    srcset=img/ux_design/designing_new_ui/competitor_confirm_button.png
    media="(max-width:767px)"> <img class="case-study-img" id="case-study-img-max"
    src=img/ux_design/designing_new_ui/competitor_confirm_button.png
    alt="A screenshot from Aviva showing four radio button options and then a confirmation button.">
  </picture>
            <p>I discussed these options with fellow designers and we concluded that - although the confirmation button would add another click - it was worth it to make sure users knew how to proceed. And similarly, we agreed the use of progressive disclosure would keep things simple for users, reducing cognitive load.</p>
            <h3>Creating and prototyping new UI</h3>
            <p>So I set about redesigning the component, introducing a more straightforward process, creating consistency between the location and investor type selection buttons, and adding a clear 'Confirm' button at the end of the process.</p>
            <p>I added comprehensive detail to the prototypes, allowing for a number of user flows and adding some extra disabled states to secondary actions to help the user focus on the main goal.</p>
            <p>I shared it with my colleagues in a Design Crit and received some useful feedback that led to a few tweaks.</p>
            <picture>
              <source

              alt="A video of a step-by-step audience selector with accordions that expand and change to a clear active state when clicked.">
            </picture>
            <h3>Testing and validating</h3>
            <p>All 6 participants, with a healthy average age of 46.5 years, successfully accomplished the given tasks. The perceived ease rating was a conclusive 4.8 out of 5.</p>
            <p>The qualitative user feedback was also supportive, with quotes like: <b>"the process couldn't be any better"</b> and <b>"self-explanatory and easy to interact"</b>.</p>
