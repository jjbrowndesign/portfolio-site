          <h3>UX maturity</h3>
          <p>
            Despite only being 6 years old, the website was - to put it bluntly
            - a mess!
          </p>
          <p>
            The UX Design function had only been introduced the year before.
            This meant, when senior stakeholders asked for their niche new
            project to be added to the main navigation bar, there was nobody to
            gatekeep and to represent the user’s interests.
          </p>

          <h3>Consistency</h3>
          <p>
            Sitewide consistency was poor, leaving the user to learn new
            patterns and UI elements on every page.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, clicking a tile on the ‘multigrid’ would sometimes take
            users to another page, sometimes open up a PDF, and sometimes do
            nothing at all.
          </p>
          <p>
            We saw this time and time again on HotJar clickmaps and UserTesting
            videos. (Never has the browser’s Back button been so popular!)
          </p>

          <h3>Navigation and accessibility</h3>
          <p>
            With no logical Information Architecture to organise content, the
            main navigation bar held 11 items at times, including short-lived
            events and links to microsites.
          </p>

            alt="The ugly old website">
          </picture>
          <p>
            Meanwhile, everywhere you looked, there were accessibility issues: from the standard body text size of 14px to the
            regular use of white text over images.
          </p>

        <!-- Part 2 -->
        <div class="hero-left">
          <h2 class="h2-accent">2. Working alongside an agency</h2>
          <p>
            Before our team was hired, the company had attached an agency to the
            project. This meant that, when we arrived, the project was already
            partway through the Discovery process. Unfortunately, this had been more focused on senior stakeholders than on user's problems.
          </p>
          <h3>Refocusing on the user</h3>
          <p>
            As a team, we therefore had a week between meetings with the agency to rapidly prototype some alternative proposals based around analytics and user testing.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each week, I would create a handful of wireframes and the UX team would discuss
            their relative merits. Then our amazing UX Researcher set up
            unmoderated user tests to get feedback on the various proposals,
            including those from the agency. They would then share their findings and we would make iterative tweaks to the most successful wireframes.
          </p>
          <p>
            As we gained the agency’s trust, we were eventually able to embed
            this user testing officially in the process.
          </p>

          <div class="hero-text">
            <p>
              The company's key products - investment funds - were presented on incredibly
              dense pages. Some key details were presented on the left sidebar,
              but due to

              users were failing to find this content. Users had to scroll down
              a
              <b>long(!)</b> page with poor text hierarchy to find content
              like factsheets, ISIN numbers and portfolios. I indentified this content was key through the Hotjar click maps:

          <div class="hero-text">
            <p>
              Our UX Researcher conducted user testing to validate this and to discover user's
              other priorities. The testing also suggested that past performance,
              holdings and prices were especially important to 80% of users.
            </p>
            <p>
              I then set up prototypes so we could test the vertical tabbed navigation
              proposed by the agency...

          <div class="hero-text">
            <p>
              The user testing revealed that the
              <b>horizontal tabbed navigation</b>
              had a higher ease of completion rating of 4.6 out 5 (compared to
              4.17 out of 5). So, after a few tweaks to the design, we were able to present our findings to the business and convinced them to move in this direction going
              forward.

            We worked together to improve some areas, especially accessibility (some 12px font sizes had crept in!).
              </p>
              <p>
               We followed a similar process throughout the planning stage of the project, until we had mockups for all the key areas of the site. It was then time to move onto the build stage...
